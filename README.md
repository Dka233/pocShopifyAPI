# pocShopifyAPI
In this repository I test the connection of my Shopify store to a console app programmed with Python

It has a config.py file that looks like this:

First of all you need to follow the shopify documentation to get access to the shopify API following the instructions in this link:

https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/basic-http#generate-private-app-credentials

Then you need to generate the token for that API and set it up in your config.py file.

Once that is done you can follow this repository to configure the access to your API:

https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_python_api

And then follow the Shopify Dev Documentation to understand and apply all the features of the API:
